# v0.2.0 migration guide

This document describes breaking changes and structured logging additions in
v0.2.0, with the steps required to update calling code. Existing logging calls
remain valid; the structured logging APIs add optional keyword arguments and
restore scoped-context propagation through named loggers.

______________________________________________________________________

## `BasicConfig` is now a slotted dataclass

`BasicConfig` (exported from `femtologging`) is now declared with
`@dataclasses.dataclass(slots=True)`. Slots remove the per-instance `__dict__`,
so a `BasicConfig` instance can no longer hold attributes beyond its five
declared fields: `level`, `filename`, `stream`, `force`, and `handlers`. The
benefit is that a mistyped or aspirational attribute name now fails loudly with
an `AttributeError` at the point of assignment, instead of silently creating a
dead attribute that the rest of the code never reads.

### What breaks

Assigning any attribute not among the declared fields now raises
`AttributeError` instead of succeeding silently.

### Before

```python
cfg = BasicConfig(level="INFO")
cfg.filename_backup = "app.log.bak"  # silently created a dead attribute
```

### After

```python
cfg = BasicConfig(level="INFO")
# `filename_backup` is not a declared field, so this now raises:
# AttributeError: 'BasicConfig' object has no attribute 'filename_backup'
cfg.filename_backup = "app.log.bak"
```

### How to migrate

- Use one of the declared fields (`level`, `filename`, `stream`, `force`,
  `handlers`) if the value belongs in `basicConfig`'s configuration surface.
- Otherwise, keep auxiliary state in the caller's own structure — a separate
  variable, dataclass, or dictionary — rather than attaching it to the
  `BasicConfig` instance.

______________________________________________________________________

## Inline structured fields

`FemtoLogger.log()`, `debug()`, `info()`, `warning()`, `error()`, and
`critical()` now accept the optional keyword-only argument `extra`:

```python
logger.info(
    "request accepted",
    extra={"request_id": 42, "user": "alice"},
)
```

`extra` must be a mapping with string keys and scalar values of type `str`,
`int`, `float`, `bool`, or `None`. The existing context limits apply: at most
64 keys, 64 UTF-8 bytes per key, 1,024 UTF-8 bytes per value, and 16 KiB of
total serialized fields per record. Invalid mappings or values raise an
exception instead of being silently discarded.

When a field is present both in `extra` and in an active `log_context`, the
inline value takes precedence. `exception()` is unchanged and does not accept
`extra`.

## Scoped context through named loggers

`log_context()` fields now reach records emitted through `FemtoLogger` methods,
including methods on loggers returned by `get_logger()`, while the context is
active in the current Python task:

```python
logger = femtologging.get_logger("service")
with femtologging.log_context(request_id=42):
    logger.info("request accepted")
```

The context follows the current Python task across `await` points. Use the
per-call `extra` argument when metadata belongs to one operation but should not
be inherited by child tasks.

## Scoped logging context follows Python tasks

Python `log_context(**fields)` used to store fields in an OS-thread-local
stack. In asynchronous code, tasks sharing an event-loop thread could observe
each other's active fields while one task was suspended. The context manager
now uses `contextvars.ContextVar`, so its fields follow the current Python
context. A newly created child task inherits a snapshot of the parent's context
at task creation; later changes in either task do not change the other's
context. Nested `log_context` scopes override same-named fields from outer
scopes.

Python logging methods and module-level logging functions copy the active
Python context when they create a record, before it is queued. Changing or
leaving the context after that call does not alter the record. For Rust
records, explicit key-values supplied by a macro or tracing event take
precedence over same-named Rust scoped fields.

Rust scoped context remains OS-thread-local. Its guard is `!Send` and `!Sync`,
and removes its own frame when dropped on the thread that created it. Keep a
Rust guard within a thread-affine synchronous scope; do not hold it across an
`await` that may resume on another thread. Rust macros and the Rust `log` and
`tracing` bridges merge Rust scoped fields when they create a record, with the
tracing bridge also retaining event and span fields. Explicit event fields take
precedence over same-named scoped fields. Python task-local fields and Rust
thread-local fields do not transfer implicitly in either direction. Pass
metadata explicitly when a request crosses that boundary.

______________________________________________________________________

## `StdlibHandlerAdapter` propagates `contextvars`

When a record is sent through `StdlibHandlerAdapter`, femtologging captures the
producer thread's `contextvars` context before queueing the record. On the
dedicated worker thread, `Context.run` calls the wrapped stdlib handler's
complete `handle()` method inside that context, including its filters,
formatters, and `emit()` method. Dispatch remains asynchronous. Existing
filters and formatters that read a `contextvars.ContextVar` therefore observe
the value set by the thread that emitted the record.

No code changes are required for this behaviour. Only `contextvars` are
propagated; other thread-local state, including `threading.local`, still
belongs to the worker thread. Update filters that depend on such state to use
`contextvars` when they need values from the emitting thread.

______________________________________________________________________

## Unchanged APIs

Reading and assigning the five declared fields (`level`, `filename`, `stream`,
`force`, `handlers`) is unchanged. Constructing `BasicConfig` and calling
`basicConfig()` remain unchanged by the slotted-dataclass and `contextvars`
propagation changes. Python-backed handlers registered directly with
`FemtoLogger` must provide contextual-dispatch support; otherwise,
`add_handler()` raises a Python `RuntimeError` with the message
`Python-backed handlers must provide contextual dispatch`, from the Rust
`HandlerError::MissingContextDispatch` variant.
