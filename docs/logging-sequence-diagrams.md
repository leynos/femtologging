Below are five **Mermaid sequence diagrams** that trace the *happy-path* control-flow inside CPython’s `logging` package (main branch, June 2025).\
I have interpreted your “`letLogger()`” as the canonical `logging.getLogger()`—there is no function named *letLogger* in the standard library.\
All call-stacks have been pared down to the routines and objects that perform real work, using the current source code for reference ([github.com](https://github.com/python/cpython/raw/main/Lib/logging/__init__.py), [github.com](https://github.com/python/cpython/raw/main/Lib/logging/__init__.py), [github.com](https://github.com/python/cpython/raw/main/Lib/logging/__init__.py), [github.com](https://github.com/python/cpython/raw/main/Lib/logging/__init__.py), [github.com](https://github.com/python/cpython/raw/main/Lib/logging/__init__.py)).

### 1 `getLogger(name)` – retrieve or create a logger

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client          as User code
    participant LoggingMod      as logging (module)
    participant Manager         as logging.Logger.manager
    participant Logger          as new/existing Logger

    Client  ->> LoggingMod: getLogger("my.app")
    LoggingMod  ->> Manager: getLogger("my.app")
    alt logger already exists
        Manager  --> LoggingMod: existing Logger
    else first request for name
        Manager  ->> Logger: __init__("my.app")
        Logger   -->> Manager: instance
        Manager  ->> Manager: loggerDict["my.app"] = Logger
        Manager  --> LoggingMod: Logger
    end
    LoggingMod  --> Client: Logger
```

### 2 `basicConfig(...)` – one-shot root logger configuration

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client          as User code
    participant LoggingMod      as logging.basicConfig()
    participant RootLogger      as logging.root
    participant Handler         as StreamHandler | FileHandler
    participant Formatter       as logging.Formatter

    Client  ->> LoggingMod: basicConfig(level=INFO,…)
    LoggingMod  ->> RootLogger: check handlers[]
    alt handlers already present and force is False
        LoggingMod  --> Client: return (no-op)
    else do initial setup
        LoggingMod  ->> Handler: create()
        LoggingMod  ->> Formatter: create()
        Formatter   ->> Handler: setFormatter()
        LoggingMod  ->> RootLogger: addHandler(Handler)
        LoggingMod  ->> RootLogger: setLevel(INFO)
        LoggingMod  --> Client: return
    end
```

### 3 `logger.info()` when *effective level = WARNING*

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as User code
    participant Logger as Logger(level=WARNING)

    Client  ->> Logger: info("hello")
    Logger  ->> Logger: isEnabledFor(INFO=20)
    note right of Logger: returns **False** :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    Logger  --> Client: return (message dropped)
```

The `INFO` record never reaches `_log()` because the short-circuit guard fails.

---

### 4 `logger.warning()` when *effective level = WARNING*

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client   as User code
    participant Logger   as Logger(level=WARNING)
    participant LogRec   as LogRecord
    participant Handler  as e.g. StreamHandler

    Client  ->> Logger: warning("something odd")
    Logger  ->> Logger: isEnabledFor(WARNING=30) ✔
    Logger  ->> Logger: _log()
    Logger  ->> LogRec: makeRecord()
    Logger  ->> Handler: handle(record)
    Handler ->> Handler: emit(record)
    Handler --> Logger: done
    Logger  --> Client: return
```

The message propagates to every handler whose own level permits it; only one generic handler is shown for brevity.

---

### 5 `shutdown()` – orderly shutdown at process exit

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client   as Application exit
    participant LoggingM as logging.shutdown()
    participant Handler  as Each handler (reverse order)

    Client  ->> LoggingM: shutdown()
    loop reversed(_handlerList)
        LoggingM ->> Handler: acquire()
        alt Handler.flushOnClose
            LoggingM ->> Handler: flush()
        end
        LoggingM ->> Handler: close()
        LoggingM ->> Handler: release()
    end
    LoggingM --> Client: return
```

`shutdown()` is automatically registered with `atexit`, so normal interpreter termination flushes and closes all live handlers ([github.com](https://github.com/python/cpython/raw/main/Lib/logging/__init__.py)).

#### Reading the diagrams

- *Participants* are real objects or modules as they appear in the current source.

- `alt`/`else` blocks show mutually exclusive paths; `loop` indicates iteration.

- Only logically significant calls are shown—locks, internal helpers and error handling are omitted unless essential to the behaviour being described.

Drop any of these diagrams straight into a Mermaid-enabled Markdown viewer (e.g. GitHub) and they will render inline.
