## Rust Port Design Notes

- [concurrency-models-in-high-performance-logging.md](./concurrency-models-in-
  high-performance-logging.md)
  - Examines picologging's hybrid lock strategy and contrasts it with Rust's
    compile-time safety and asynchronous patterns.
- [core_features.md](./core_features.md)
  - Summarizes picologging's key features prioritized for the Rust port.
- [formatters-and-handlers-rust-port.md](./formatters-and-handlers-rust-port.md)
  - Design for moving formatter and handler logic to Rust with thread safety.
- [logger-hierarchy-and-multi-handler.md](./logger-hierarchy-and-multi-
  handler.md)
  - Describes how loggers share handlers and inherit configuration via dotted
    names.
- [rust-extension.md](./rust-extension.md)
  - Describes the small PyO3-based Rust extension shipped in the project.
- [cpython-abi-management-in-rust-with-pyo3.md](./cpython-abi-management-in-
  rust-with-pyo3.md)
  - Comprehensive guide to managing CPython ABI compatibility with PyO3.
- [rust-multithreaded-logging-framework-for-python-design.md](./rust-
  multithreaded-logging-framework-for-python-design.md)
  - Proposes a multithreaded Rust logging framework with strong compile-time
    safety.
- [rust-testing-with-rstest-fixtures.md](./rust-testing-with-rstest-fixtures.md)
  - Explains how to use the `rstest` crate for fixture-based tests.
